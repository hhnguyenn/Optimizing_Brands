## Scenario <br/>
I am a regional marketing director of a theme park in the United States that is part of a global brand.  <br/>
The chief marketing officer of global operatios has called upon me to help coordinate the marketing tasks related to rolling out an emergency response to a recent safety and injury incident at one of the parks that resulted in serious injuries to employees and customers.  This theme park was closed immediately following the incident to ensure safety measure for customers and employees and to deploy the needed safety measures. <br/>

The CMO has called upon me to take a lead in planning the marketing strategy to support the reopening of the park.  The responsibility is to design a phased strategy for reopening all parks, with critical objectives such as maximum safety, crisis communication, customer satisfaction, and profit potential.  Coordinating marketing strategy with corporate strategies, as failed or successful planning will impact brand success and recognition.
